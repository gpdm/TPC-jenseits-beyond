# Compiling The Sources

To compile `jenseits` (`beyond`) and `confram`, you must
use at least *Turbo Pascal 4.0*.

For compiling `sysmap`, you must use at least *Turbo C 2.0*.

A (makefile)[MAKEFILE]* is provided for your convenience.
It supports the following targets:

```
all		make all targets
de		make german version
en		make english version
clean		remove obj and exe files
```

*) The makefile has only been tested with `make` supplied with Turbo Pascal 4.0 and Turbo C 2.0!
